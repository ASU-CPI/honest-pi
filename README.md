#What's an Honest Policy Informatician To Do?

This [article](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/blob/master/article/article.md) is an exploration of the relationship between evidence and beliefs in public policy discussions. 

But this is also an experiment in collaborative group writing. We are inviting anyone to help us write and improve this article by joining us on [GitHub](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi). Rather than deciding beforehand who the list of authors will be and then working together to write the article - by, for example, emailing subsequent versions of Word documents with track changes enabled to each other, or using a wiki-type environment to accommodate changes submitted by any contributor - we are opening this writing process to anyone interested. 

We fully anticipate that persuading colleagues to participate in this experiment will not be easy; but we believe that there is enormous potential in this approach. Above all, however, this is truly an experiment - we don't know what will happen. Will the group fragment and fail to meet its objective? Will conflicts be unresolvable? Will authorship become too contentious to determine? Can traditional academic incentives attached to authorship be accommodated within GitHub? Will anyone contribute? Will too many show up? 

Uncertainty is usually exciting. Welcome to a very uncertain experiment.
