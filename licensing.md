Needless to say - well, maybe we should make this explicit - this experiment can be freely forked by anyone to write a different article, or for a different collaborative process, using the framework we set out here or modified to how you see fit. Perhaps you can think of better rules, or a more interesting topic, or you think you can write a better version of this article than us and get it published first. 

As Abby Hoffman wrote: "Fork this Repo!" If you do fork it for another, similar, collaborative writing purpose, we would simply encourage you to join us in the second stage of this experiment: i.e., [analyzing and writing up the results](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/github-experiment).
