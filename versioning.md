##Guidelines for Version Numbers 
version 0.1.0

Each file will start with version number 0.1.0 at project launch and be increased with each release based on [Apache Foundation Versioning Guidelines](http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html). 

Though text documents do not have the same dependency issues that code does, versions will be denoted using a standard triplet of integers: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. 

- MAJOR versions indicate significant and comprehensive changes or progressions to the document or file, such as wholesale structural re-ordering. 
- MINOR versions indicate less significant changes such as additions of text within the current structure.
- PATCH versions indicate minor changes such as typos.
