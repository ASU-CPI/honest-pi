#Notes on Creating, Maintaining and Completing this Experiment

This is a place for recording observations on the conduct of this experiment. Please add to this. Observations are currently in no particular order:

-setting up the structure prior to launch took a lot of time. Right before launching, I forked the repos for the Honest-PI and GitHub Experiment to my account to have them available for re-use.
-the structure for the article was broken up into individual files and placed in its own [folder](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/tree/master/article) to make it easier to manage.
-assumption is that a [master version](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/blob/master/article/article.md) of the complete article will be published once per week during the experiment.
-[licensing](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/blob/master/licensing.md) was establish, but no CLA was implemented (too legalistic and would likely have reduced participation). 
-contributors were solicited through an open call (e.g., via the CPI blog, Twitter, etc.) and targeted invitations
-the management of contributions was left undefined. A PMC (project management committee) consisted of [one collaborator](https://github.com/JustinLongo) at project start, with the anticipation that additional members would be added.
