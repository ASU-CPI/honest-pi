###Contributing

You can [raise issues](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/issues), issue a [pull request](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/pulls) or contribute to the [wiki](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/wiki). We are not concerned with who you are or how significant you think your contribution is. Start by pionting out a typo. Then dive in to more significant changes.

First Time on GitHub? Don't Know Where to Start? First thing is to [Sign Up for GitHub](https://github.com/join).

After you have a GitHub account you can [go straight to the article and start writing](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/edit/master/article.md#fullscreen_blob_contents). Don't worry - you won't break anything (probably). When you're done, you'll see a little square in the top right hand corner - click on it and you should probably be able to figure your way along from there.

But if you want to learn a bit about GitHub first, try our [beginner tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ZZqDhD-Ax4rmfma6Hi26RTREB-ApKZHzht5TBzWdjY/edit).

*A key guideline for contributing*: GitHub is not an ideal platform for text collaboration. One big limitation is that multiple changes to one file submitted in a pull request cannot be selectively "accepted" as with, for example, a Word document. To accommodate this, changes submitted as pull requests should be limited to one line or, at most, one paragraph. For more substantial changes (e.g., discussions about major structural changes), you can [raise an issue](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/issues) or talk about it on the [wiki](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/wiki).
