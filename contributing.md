#Contributing
version 0.1.3

You can [raise issues](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/issues), issue a [pull request](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/pulls) or contribute to the [wiki](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/wiki). We are not concerned with who you are or how significant you think your contribution is. Start by corecting a typo. Then dive in to more significant changes.

First Time on GitHub? Don't Know Where to Start? First thing is to [Sign Up for GitHub](https://github.com/join).

After you have a GitHub account you can [go straight to the article repository](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/edit/master/article). Don't worry - you won't break anything (probably).

##Simple Editing
If you want an easier way to make changes, try this: 

1. Make sure you are logged into GitHub.
2. In another tab or window go to http://prose.io/ and click on "Authorize of GitHub". 
3. If all goes according to plan, you should then be able to go to http://prose.io/#ASU-CPI/honest-pi and see a clearer path to edit any of the files you want. 
4. Just click on a file, start adding, deleting, changing ... 
5. When done, click the save icon on the right hand side, then click on the "Commit" button. 

##Problems?

You can also help to build the data that will support the second part of this experiment - [a research paper that will observe and report on the process of writing the first article](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/github-experiment) - by recording any observations or thoughts on the process in this [running file of notes on this process](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/github-experiment/blob/master/notes.md).

But if you want to learn a bit about GitHub first, try our [beginner tutorial](http://nextpolicychallenge.github.io/tutorial.html).

Formatting in GitHub requires the use of Markdown. But don't let that scare you. You can craft in Word, and then convert that to Markdown with this [handy app](http://word-to-markdown.herokuapp.com/).

*A key guideline for contributing*: GitHub is not an ideal platform for text collaboration. One big limitation is that multiple changes to one file submitted in a pull request cannot be selectively "accepted" as with, for example, a Word document. To accommodate this, changes submitted as pull requests should be limited to one line or, at most, one paragraph. For more substantial changes (e.g., discussions about major structural changes), you can [raise an issue](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/issues) or talk about it on the [wiki](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/wiki).
