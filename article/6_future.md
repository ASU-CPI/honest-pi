  Can we create subcategories here: 
  - Uncertainty
  - Conflict and Governance
  - Future societal needs that will require use of information and collaboration
  - etc. 
- what promising avenues need to be further investigated?
  - Technology and beliefs
  - Technology and collaboration

Text for addition in future societal needs

As we have discussed, societal problems continue to be relevant and complex. Understanding the dynamics between people and technology in decision making will become ever more relevant as time goes on. There are even larger global scale challenges that will require the premeditated collaboration of all governments and international organizations of the world. The upcoming Policy Challenge, a collaborative challenge hosted by the White House, provides a venue for participants to consider such upcoming challenges. One example is that of climate engineering. Another is the need for advanced space flight, particularly when paired with information about the high number of asteroids that currently hit Earth and the point that eventually one large enough to do severe damage will hit. 

Text for promising avenues for further investigation

A promising development in the advancement of decision making comes from our awareness of how our beliefs impact our interpretations and use of data. If people are aware of biases or preferences, it is possible to train on an individual and group level to look more critically at relevant information. Many of the authors of this article work at the Center for Policy Informatics, where the connection between decision making, technology, and complex problems are actively being studied. This work comes through the study of different structural configurations in online environments (Policy Challenge and 10,000 Solutions), the study of empathy in collaborative decision making, and theoretical explorations of collaborative governance. The Center of Policy Informatics is joined by other centers and individuals studying the connection of intentionality, technology, and the mind.
