#Discussion
version 0.2.0

- how can we resolve the apparent disconnect?
- does open data offer a solution? see e.g., 
     - [How open climate data can improve community resilience against climate change](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-open-climate-data-can-improve-community-resilience-against-climate-change/) and

### Potential addition to discussion section:

Looking at the influence of the human mind on data interpretation, it is possible to feel discouraged about the likelihood of achieving the aspirations of Open Government. However, to do so would be to discount the impact of continued reflection and evolving practice. There is immense potential in people becoming aware of their behaviors and inclinations. This means that with constructive framing, people can learn to approach data differently than they would have done so before.  

note from Stone (2012): why a completely rational approach ("just the facts") misses the point of policy making:
- the rational policy sciences approach sees politics as a paradox because the messiness of politics clashes with the world view of the rationality project. While politics has a dark, self-interested side that produces conflict, politics is also the route by which passions lead to creative solutions.
- rationality prides itself on being above politics; but the lenses that rationality brings to analysis are the product themselves of political claims not universal truths (see also Lasswell's normative basis of the the policy sciences).
- the rational policy approach is dominated by economics, which sees human interactions in terms of market mechanisms - which describes a world very different from most human interactions and community forms. 

### Some Text from the original blog post: 
Public policy analysis a generation ago was characterized by a belief that more evidence will lead to better decisions, that education is the foundation of rational behaviour, and that in a democracy we should begin with a discussion of the facts. There’s a quote attributed to the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan - “Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts” - that characterizes this period in the 1970s, a golden age of policy debate during which Senator Moynihan was a key player.

That era appears to be well over (if it ever really existed). But in its wake, we are left wondering what hope there is for fields like policy informatics that seek to inform public discourse to enhance collaborative governance? In an environment like this, what’s an honest policy informatician to do?

In this post-positivist era, we're suspecting that it is not "information is what changes us" (Stafford Beer, [Platform for Change](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471948403.html), p. 243); rather information is what we believe it is. So what can change us and “facilitate informed and empowered deliberation and action” as our mission statement urges us to strive for?

While information can be transmitted in documents and videos and conversations, it will lack resonance and tangibility with the recipient in the absence of experience or feeling. This is partly addressed by what people like David Roberts argue for (“[The Futility of ‘Just the Facts’ Climate Science”](http://grist.org/climate-energy/the-futility-of-just-the-facts-climate-science/)) in the bringing together of science and politics, for scientists to bring their values together with their findings when they communicate their findings: “if scientists want the information they convey to be understood and absorbed [to have meaning for their audience], they will have to speak as humans speak, from within a cultural identity and a set of values, not hovering above such mortal concerns.”

If we assume that the aforementioned evidence is correct, that “individuals will reflect and reinforce values they share with others” and that conflict over public policy is fostered by fundamentally different cultural worldviews and values, we start to wonder how we can build shared experiences, influence mental models and promote cultural consensus that will enhance collaborative decision making.

In the Center for Policy Informatics, we explore the potential for technology, computer simulation and participatory modeling to change mental models, perspectives and ultimately behavior. We measure the influence of games and visualization on mental models and beliefs. As just one example, LinkIT ([LinkIT: A Ludic Elicitation Game for Eliciting Risk Perceptions](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2012.01907.x/abstract), by Yan Cao and William L. McGill) is a game-like tool designed to elicit group understanding of the relations between risk factors.
