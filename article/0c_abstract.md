Policy informatics is an emerging discipline built on the idea that complex public policy challenges are best addressed through the leveraging of computation and communication technologies that harness knowledge and facilitate informed deliberation and collective action. At the core of the policy informatics movement are several premises, including that the objective of evidence-based analysis is to better inform deliberation and decision making, and that better-informed decisions are superior to less-informed decisions. Recent research and experience seems to indicate, however, that basic analytical functions are influenced by one's beliefs, that evidence is often selectively used to support one's argument, and that "facts" rarely succeed in changing one's decisions. If these findings are true, they would seem to undermine the founding principles of policy informatics. We review the explainations of the current state of evidence-based deliberation and policy making and propose a recalibration of the objectives for policy informatics that better reflect the political and psychological underpinnings of decision making.
