Policy informatics is an emerging discipline built on the idea that complex public policy challenges are best addressed through the leveraging of computation and communication technologies that improve data collection, enhance analysis, harness knowledge in support of decision making, facilitate informed deliberation and provide mechanisms for rational collective action. At the core of the policy informatics movement are several premises, including that the objective of evidence-based analysis should be to better inform deliberation and decision making, and that better-informed decisions are preferred to less-informed decisions. Recent research and experience seems to indicate, however, that basic analytical functions are influenced by one's beliefs, that evidence is often selectively used to support one's argument, and that "facts" supporting a contrary position rarely succeed in changing one's beliefs, position or decision. If these findings are true, they would seem to undermine the founding principles of policy informatics, or at least question teh relevance of policy informatics in political debate and decision making. We review the explanations of the current state of evidence-based deliberation and policy making and propose a recalibration of the objectives for policy informatics that better reflect the political and psychological underpinnings of decision making.
