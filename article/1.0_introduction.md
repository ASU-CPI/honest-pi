- what is the ideal of public deliberation in open governance?
- what is the reality of how evidence is used in goverance discussions, especially online?
- is there a fundamental disconnect between this ideal and the current reality?


###Some Text from the original blog post:

The developing field of policy informatics is based in part on the belief that complex public policy challenges can be addressed in part “by leveraging cutting-edge computation and communication technology to meaningfully connect people, harness knowledge, and facilitate informed and empowered deliberation, solution-generation, and action.” (["CPI Mission Statement," 2014](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/blob/master/article/references.md)).  

In the fall of 2013, we began to notice increasing Internet chatter highlighting research suggesting that a person’s ability to solve a mathematical problem is affected by their beliefs. In most instances 2 + 2 = 4. Except - it turns out - that if the answer 4 conflicts with your beliefs or preferences, a different answer is more likely to be chosen if it aligns with your beliefs. And then, it gets worse: telling you that the answer is 4 may only cause you to more strongly hold onto your insistence that it’s actually 30. Or -5. Or that the premise of the question is flawed.

Such a deeply troubling finding caused us to ask: how can we have open governance - indeed, how can we hope to have any kind of rationale governance - when we can’t rely on evidence to frame our discussions? Moreover, how can we hope to facilitate informed decisions and actions when ideological beliefs trump scientific facts? This article is an investigation of this challenge.



Beginning draft

A fundamental assumption of policy informatics is that people can be empowered to make better decisions about their individual lives and society as a whole. This relies on the belief that access to information will change the way individuals think, learn, and act.
