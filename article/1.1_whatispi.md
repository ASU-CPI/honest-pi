##What is Policy Informatics
version 0.2.0

This sub-section would contextualize the issue by defining what policy informatics is and why the problem of an inability to agree on a factual foundation prior to debating an issue should be problematic for PI.

Advances in computational and communication technologies are revolutionizing our approaches to data-intensive science, big data, generative science, simulation, collaborative science and open governance.

Some objectives of policy informatics are beginning to emerge:
- to strenghten technology competencies amongst public administrators across a range of techniques from working with complex policy scenarios to bringing diverse stakeholders together in technology-enabled forums. 
- to promote appropriate risk-taking in technology deployment, to the end of making public institutions more robust and improving the degree to which they are perceived as legitimate.  
- to broaden the scope of public agencies and redefine their relevance in advancing the public interest through new ways of looking at, processing and utilizing information.
- to leverage information and data with greater relevancy, potency, and creativity to address common interests, shared issues, and public problems.
