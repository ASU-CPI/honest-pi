##What is Policy Informatics
version 1.0.0

Policy informatics centers on the study of how computational, information and communication technologies are leveraged to understand and address complex public policy and administration problems, and support new governance processes. It is built on the fundamental premise that technology can be efficiently and effectively mobilized in support of evidence-based policy analysis, design and implementation. Policy informatics advances the goal of building public governance that is transparent, collaborative, participatory and legitimate. 

Although an emerging discipline, three distinct research clusters are seen as developing: analysis; governance infrastructures; and processes. Analysis focuses on the assembling of data as the basis of evidence; visualizing information; and modeling complex policy environments. Governance research focuses on building the next-generation of public institutions; designing open, collaborative and participatory governance platforms; building participatory platforms to leverage collective intelligence; and promoting innovation in public institutions. Processes focuses on understanding how the adoption of technology changes the policy process; how technology affects administrative processes; and how technology-enabled networks support collaborative governance (Desouza and Johnston, forthcoming).
