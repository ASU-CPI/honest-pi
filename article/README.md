version 0.2.0

This is the folder containing all the component parts of the article under development.

The files have been named so they listed here in a way that corresponds to their order in the document under development. Some preliminary files start with the number 0 to force them to the top of the order. (Believe it or not, GitHub does not allow you to sort the file listing, so this trick was necessary to get the files in some order).

Start with the file [outline.md](001_outline.md) to see the structure and links to component parts. 

Or go straight to the [Master Document of all component parts](01_article.md) as it exists as of today. 

For more substantial changes (e.g., discussions about major structural changes), please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/issues) or talk about it on the [wiki](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/wiki).

Please see the main [README](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/blob/master/README.md) for details on this article and the collaborative writing experiment underlying it.
