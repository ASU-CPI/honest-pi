###Research Questions

Our objectives are, first, to try and write a good article and to do it efficiently. But we are also exploring a number of research questions, namely whether:

- a group of academic authors can come together using the GitHub platform to collaboratively write an academic article that is successfully submitted to and accepted by a reputable peer-reviewed journal of the group's choosing,
- discussions amongst the group members can be accommodated entirely on the GitHub platform (i.e., the repo's wiki, issues and pull requests),
- the article can be written in under 2 months from the date that it is publicly deployed to the date it is submitted to a journal,
- GitHub's network metrics (e.g., [pulse](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/pulse), [graphs](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/graphs), [network](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/honest-pi/network)) in combination with the evaluation of the participating group members can be used to determine authorship,
- the opportunity to be listed as an author will provide sufficient incentive for potential authors to contribute,
- group decisions, including changing any of the "rules of the game", can be made by the members of the group using [principles of consensus decision-making](http://consensusdecisionmaking.org/Articles/Basics%20of%20Consensus%20Decision%20Making.html).

An evaluation of these research questions in light of this experiment will be the subject of a [subsequent article](https://github.com/ASU-CPI/github-experiment) using the same process used to write this article.
